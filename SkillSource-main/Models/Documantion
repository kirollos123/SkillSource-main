## User Model Documentation

### Namespace
`Models`

### Inheritance
- Extends: `Support\Model`
- Implements: `Support\Contracts\ModelInterface`

### Properties
- `protected static $fillable` (array): List of attributes that can be mass-assigned.
  - `name` (string): The user's name.
  - `email` (string): The user's email address.
  - `password` (string): The user's password (hashed).
  - `phone` (string): The user's phone number.
  - `account_type` (string): The type of user account.

### Example Usage

```php
use Models\User;

// Creating a new user instance
$user = new User([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john.doe@example.com',
    'password' => password_hash('password123', PASSWORD_BCRYPT),
    'phone' => '123-456-7890',
    'account_type' => 'standard'
]);

// Saving the user to the database
$user->save();
```

### Notes
- Ensure the `password` attribute is hashed before saving the user to the database.
- The `fillable` array protects against mass-assignment vulnerabilities. Only the listed attributes can be mass-assigned.

### Conclusion
The `User` model provides a structured way to interact with user data, leveraging the capabilities of `Support\Model` and ensuring compliance with `Support\Contracts\ModelInterface`.
