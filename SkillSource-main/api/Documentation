Creating a simple documentation for a PHP script that includes a file can be straightforward. Here's a concise example:

## Documentation for `require __DIR__ . '/../public/index.php';`

### Description
This PHP script includes the `index.php` file located in the `public` directory one level up from the current directory. 

### Usage
This script is typically used to bootstrap or initialize the application by including the main entry point (`index.php`).

### Code
```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/../public/index.php';
```

### Key Points
- **`__DIR__`**: This magic constant returns the directory of the current script.
- **`require`**: This statement includes and evaluates the specified file. If the file is not found, it will cause a fatal error and stop the script.
- **`../public/index.php`**: This path navigates one directory up (`..`) and then into the `public` directory to include the `index.php` file.

### Example Use Case
This script is often used in web applications to centralize the inclusion of the main configuration and routing logic located in `index.php`. This approach helps in maintaining a clean and organized directory structure.

### Error Handling
- If the `index.php` file is not found in the specified path, a fatal error will occur, and the script will stop executing.
- Ensure the path is correct relative to the script's location to avoid path errors.

This documentation provides a clear and concise explanation of what the script does, how it is used, and key details about its functionality.
